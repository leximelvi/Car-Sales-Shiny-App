# Car-Sales-Shiny-App

I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.

Many people rely on cars for transportation. I wanted to do a project on marketing to help sales people determine if there were patterns to determine who (gender/income) is buying what type of car (model/features).

I approached this overarching question by looking at data of different car companies and then breaking it down even further with each company's models. I took a look at the cost of certain body style and models, whether a specific color were sold more than others, and if each gender had a preference of car model.  I then compared the cost of the car and the income of the consumer for each model and region to see if there was a relationship. Lastly, I looked closer at the features and buyers to see if there were patterns of who was buying which type of car.

For this project, I focused on 30 car companies to analyze. The question is: Is there a specific type of car/features people are buying?
